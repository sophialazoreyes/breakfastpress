				<h1> Nagniningning sa Liwanag</h1>
				<p> Last November 30, 2018, the PGLU opened the Pasko sa Kapitolyo.
				This was actually the first time San Fernando La Union opened a Christmas
			    Village. There were lots to see,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> there were even some food stalls and other 
			     things to witness. I wasn't really expecting it to be as beautiful as it looks like in their page, but as 
			 soon as I got to the place, I was just blown away. It really felt like a magical place.</span> </p>

			Recently, San Fernando City, La Union launched an Application called
			PARA where in the means of commuting or travelling has become less stressful.
			One of the problems that we ,citizens from San Fernando are encountering right now is 
			having a hard time commuting, especially during rush hour. When residents need to commute to any part of the city, 
			they pull out their smartphones, book a ride and wait for a tricycle to fetch them.They now use “Para,” 
			a tricycle booking app developed by Jovan Ortega, president and chief operating officer of Para Software Inc.

				<h1> Rambak Pamilya 2018 </h1>
				<p> Just last November 24, Ckcians celebrated the annual Rambak Pamilya which was held
				at Christ the King College, High School Department. Today is the last year I am going
				to celebrate Rambak Pamilya as a Ckcian.I am going to miss all the events and the also the stalls every
				time we have our Rambak. Rambak Pamilya symbolizes our school and the whole institution. It makes me unhappy 
				everytime I remember that is going to be my last celebrating not only the Rambak, but also missing all the school
				events and the memories. </p>
